Duplicate values were checked and none were found.\n","\n","**Data Wrangling:**\n","Data wrangling began with creating a copy of the dataset to maintain the integrity of the original data. Incorrect data types were addressed, and irrelevant identifier columns were dropped. Missing values were strategically handled, and outliers in certain columns were identified and replaced.\n","The dataset was further refined by eliminating rows with zero prices and grouping prices for better analysis.\n","\n","**Price Analysis:**\n","An in-depth analysis of prices revealed that most listings fell within the 10-200 USD range. Specific price groups were created for better analysis, uncovering patterns such as shared rooms dominating the 10-50 USD range and entire home/apartment listings peaking at 300 USD. A detailed breakdown of room types and neighborhood contributions was presented through visualizations.\n","\n","**Room Preferences:**\n","Despite being the costliest option, Entire home/apartment listings were the most preferred, constituting over half of the total listings. Private rooms followed, while shared rooms were the least favored. This suggested a preference for privacy and spacious options, with customers willing to pay more for such listings.\n","\n","**Factors Influencing Prices:**\n","The analysis highlighted that room type and neighborhood groups were the primary factors influencing prices. The flow of prices for different room types was explored, revealing distinct ranges for shared and private rooms compared to the broader range for entire home/apartment listings.\n","\n","**Neighborhood Analysis:**\n","Manhattan emerged as the costliest neighborhood, followed by Brooklyn, Staten Island, Queens, and Bronx. Scatter plots demonstrated the lack of a clear correlation between latitude/longitude values and listing prices, emphasizing the neighborhood's significance.\n","\n","**Minimum Nights Preferences**:\n","Hosts predominantly preferred guests to book for minimum 1-3 nights, with a gradual decline in preference. An unusual rise at 11 days marked an interesting observation in the minimum nights density plot.\n","\n","**Availability Analysis:**\n","The availability of listings throughout the year exhibited an inverse relationship with the number of listings in an area. Staten Island had the highest mean availability, while Manhattan and Brooklyn had the least. Similar patterns were observed across different room types.\n","\n","In conclusion, this EDA provided valuable insights into the factors influencing Airbnb listings, prices, and availability. The findings provide valuable insights for both hosts and potential guests, contributing to a nuanced understanding of the Airbnb market dynamics. The analysis showcased patterns and preferences, contributing to a better understanding of the dynamics within the dataset."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["https://github.com/raza209/AlmaBetterCapstoneProject2_Airbnb_EDA-Mustufa-/tree/main"],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT**\n","\n","Business: Airbnb, Inc. is a San Francisco-based American company that operates a digital marketplace facilitating short- and long-term homestays and experiences.

Simultaneously, we aim to uncover the needs and offerings hosts have for their business, such as availability preferences and other relevant factors.\n","\n","Through a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on this dataset, we seek to enhance our understanding of the nuanced requirements of both customers and hosts.
